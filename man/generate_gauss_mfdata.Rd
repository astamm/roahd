\usage{
generate_gauss_mfdata(
  N,
  L,
  centerline,
  correlations,
  listCov = NULL,
  listCholCov = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{the number of distinct functional observations to generate.}

\item{L}{the number of components of the multivariate functional data.}

\item{centerline}{the centerline of the distribution, represented as a
2-dimensional data structure with L rows (one for each dimension) having the
measurements along the grid as columns.}

\item{correlations}{is the vector containing the \eqn{1/2 L (L-1)}
correlation coefficients \eqn{\rho_{ij}} in the model generating data.
They have to be provided in the following order:
\deqn{(\rho_{1,2},\ldots,\rho_{1,L},\rho_{2,3},\ldots,\rho_{2,L},\ldots,
\rho_{L,L-1}),}
that is to say, the row-wise, upper triangular part of the correlation matrix
without the diagonal.}

\item{listCov}{a list containing the \eqn{L} covariance operators (provided
in form of a \eqn{P \times P}{P x P} matrix), one for each component of the
multivariate functional random variable, that have to be used in the
generation of the processes \eqn{\epsilon_1(t), \ldots, \epsilon_L(t)}.
At least one argument between \code{listCov} and \code{listCholCov} must be
different from \code{NULL}.}

\item{listCholCov}{the Cholesky factor of the \eqn{L} covariance operators
(in \eqn{P \times P}{P x P} matrix form), one for each component of the
multivariate functional random variable, that have to be used in the
generation of the processes \eqn{\epsilon_1(t), \ldots, \epsilon_L(t)}.
At least one argument between \code{listCov} and \code{listCholCov} must be
different from \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list of L matrices, one for each component of
the multivariate functional random variable, containing the discretized
values of the generated observations (in form of \eqn{N \times P}{N x P}
matrices).
}
\description{
\code{generate_gauss_mfdata} generates a dataset of multivariate functional
data with a desired mean and covariance function in each dimension and a
desired correlation structure among components.
}
\details{
In particular, the following model is considered for the generation of data:

\deqn{X(t) = ( m_1( t ) + \epsilon_1( t ), \ldots, m_L(t) +
 \epsilon_L(t)), \quad t \in I = [a, b]}{ X(t) = ( m_1( t ) +
 \epsilon_1(t), ..., m_L(t) + \epsilon_L(t) ), for all  t in I = [a, b] }

where \eqn{L} is the number of components of the multivariate functional
random variable, \eqn{m_i(t)} is the \eqn{i-}th component of the center and
\eqn{\epsilon_i(t)} is a centered gaussian process with covariance function
\eqn{C_i}. That is to say:

\deqn{Cov( \epsilon_{i}(s), \epsilon_{i}(t) ) = C( s, t ), \quad \forall i =
 1, \ldots, L, \quad \forall s, t \in I}{Cov( \epsilon_i(s),
  \epsilon_i(t) ) = C( s, t ),  with  i =
 1, \ldots, L, and with s, t in I}

A correlation structure among \eqn{\epsilon_1(t),\ldots,\epsilon_L(t)} is
allowed in the following way:

\deqn{ Cor( \epsilon_i(t), \epsilon_j(t)) = \rho_{i,j}, \quad \forall
i \neq j, \quad \forall t \in I.}{ Cor( \epsilon_i(t), \epsilon_j(t)  ) =
\rho_ij, for all i != j and for all t in I.}

All the functions are supposed to be observed on an evenly-spaced, one-
dimensional grid of P points: \eqn{[ a = t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{P-1} = b]
\subset I }.

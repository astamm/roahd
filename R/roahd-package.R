#' roahd: RObust Analysis for High dimensional Data.
#'
#' A package meant to collect and provide methods for the analysis of univariate
#' and multivariate functional datasets through the use of robust methods, with
#' special focus on computation of depths and outlier detection.
#' Special care was devoted to the efficient implementation of robust methods,
#' so that they can be employed also in high-dimensional datasets,
